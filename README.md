# CRAFT
Description: Online prosody acoustics teaching platform, aimed at students of phonetics and related disciplines, with the goal of raising critical awareness in the handling of tools for the analysis of rhythm and melody of speech.

HTML GUI Input selections:
1. Data (fixed selection, no uploading)
2. Parameter selection (algorithm choice, parameter choice, figure dimensions)

HTML GUI Output:
Frame containing mainly graphs and statistical analyses and comparison of speech signal transformations.

Methods:
1. CRAFT: Fundamental frequency (F0, 'pitch') estimation algorithms and parameters. Branched.
2. CR0FT: Comparison of standard F0 estimation parameters RAPT and Praat with S0FT, a simple parametrised F0 tracker. Not included at this time.
3. Amplitude and Frequency modulation demo. Not included at this time.
4. S0FT: FM demodulation with FFT peak, zero-crossing and peak-picking algorithms and combinations. Not included at this time.
5. SoundOps: Demos of Butterworth filters and Fourier and Hilbert transforms. Not included at this time.
